**Note** Glyph is currently in very early development. We're just as excited as you are about it, but we want our initial releases to be simple and easy to use. We hope you understand why the source is currently private. We hope to make it public as soon as possible.

If you are interested in the project or have any questions, please ask on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aw795pAzxD).
